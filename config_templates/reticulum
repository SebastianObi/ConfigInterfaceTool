  # a local socket. This is completely transparent to the
  # user, and should generally be turned on. This directive
  # is optional and can be removed for brevity.

  # local IPv6 is enabled in your operating system, which
  # should be enabled by default in almost any OS. See
  # the Reticulum Manual for more configuration options.
